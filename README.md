Music streaming is a popular way of consuming music today. From Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, among others to AudioMack, these streaming platforms are an excellent way for artistes to market and monetize their music. Moreover, these platforms present opportunities for artistes, Record Labels, Artist Managers, and other stakeholders in the music industry to gain insights into how listeners consume their music. Also, the data generated from these streaming platforms are used for various research in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The examples include Music Recommendation, Music Generation, and Hit Song Prediction. This study investigates how audio features can help in predicting the popularity of a song. I scrapped 2000 Ghanaian hiplife songs using the Spotify Web API, which offers developer access to its Music Catalogue and extracted relevant audio features for each of the songs. Using Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Na√Øve Bayes Classification algorithms, I built a model to predict the popularity of a song. The result showed that although audio features offer a sufficiently useful way to predict the popularity of a song, there might be other features other than audio features that can explain the popularity of the song.
